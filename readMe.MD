# ${1:reactingToSimon}
TODO: I built this app in jquery/vanilla js for my first WDI project. The entire app took about a day to put together. I'm now working on building it in react before Wednesday of next week to see if it's something I can implement(I want a live scoreboard, some variations, and just want to try the challenge).
## Installation
